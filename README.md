# 🚗 US Traffic Accidents Big Data Analysis (2016–2021)

This project applies **big data analysis and visualization** techniques using **Apache Spark** and **Python** to explore and understand traffic accident trends across the United States. The dataset contains over 7.5 million accident records from 2016 to 2021.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze accident severity trends across U.S. states.
- Perform scalable processing on a dataset too large for traditional tools.
- Apply Apache Spark for big data aggregation.
- Visualize results to identify high-risk states.
- Evaluate accident patterns for potential real-world improvements.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle – US Accidents (2016–2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)
- **Size**: ~7.5 million rows, 49 features
- **File used**: `preprocessed_accidents.csv` (after cleaning and reduction)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- Apache Spark 3.5.5
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- VS Code (Local execution on Windows 10)

## 🔥 Key Features

- Apache Spark used to process millions of rows efficiently.
- Aggregated **average severity by state**.
- Converted Spark DataFrames to Pandas for output due to native I/O limitations on Windows.
- Clean, visual bar chart showing severity patterns across states.
- CSV output and visualization generated locally.
